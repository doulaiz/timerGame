# Timer Game

A minimalist web timer game where you try to click before the hidden timer runs out. The timer is visually indicated by a shrinking vertical bar on the left, and the UI provides subtle feedback as time runs out.

## Features
- Click anywhere to start or restart the hidden timer.
- Timer duration is configurable via the settings button (⏱️) in the top right.
- The left vertical bar shrinks as time passes, giving a discreet visual cue.
- The screen flashes as the timer nears zero, and turns red if you run out of time.
- After timeout, the first click resets the state, the second click restarts the timer.
- Water drop sound and ripple effect on click for satisfying feedback.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click anywhere to start the timer.
3. Click the ⏱️ button to set a custom timer duration.
4. Try to click again before the timer runs out!
