# Timer Game

A minimalist web timer game where you try to click before the timer runs out. Ideal for board games where the player needs to do an action before a certain amount of time, and then it's next person's turn.

## Features
- Click anywhere to start or restart the timer.
- Timer duration is configurable via the settings in the top right.
- The left vertical bar shrinks as time passes, giving a discreet visual cue.
- The screen flashes as the timer nears zero, and turns red if you run out of time.
- After timeout, reset the state and restart the timer.
